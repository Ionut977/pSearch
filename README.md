# pSearch
 Searching tool written in Python for Piracy related websites. You choose where you want to search, and the program does its own work and shows you the results. It is similar to normal search engines, however the program searches the site on-spot rather than having a database with different results.

~ If you see a terminal/command line opening when you run the program, don't worry about it! It's for showing errors, that way you and I can see the error easily. 

## Requirements and Running
This software uses <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/" target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/" target="_blank">CustomTkinter</a>. Use this command within the extracted folder to install everything from the requirements.txt file, or you can manually from PyPI:
 
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure you have pip and Python installed. 
Keep in mind, running it with native Python will always be faster than with a UI/web version, once you install Python and the requirements it's easy and fast to run it.

    Open terminal in the program's folder (from Linux point) and run
        python3 pSearch.py
        
But as an alternative and a faster method, I also build the program in a standalone executable file which you can download from every release.

 ## Notice
 This tool doesn't let you download files. Simply just a search tool. It doesn't grab direct download links, it just searches and gives you the original pages of the website. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING WITH THIS TOOL.
 
 ### Violation Notes
 This program shouldn't violate any ToS's of the websites included as it doesn't grab the download links. It still forwards to the original website, just the software's page of it.

#### Contribution 
Can be directly done by using https://sqlitebrowser.org/ and opening the database file, or use db_adder.py from the others folder. And check the Wiki page for contribution.
