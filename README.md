# pSearch
 Searching tool written in Python for Piracy related websites. Asks you where to search, or if you want you can search in all of the websites available. Gives you maximum results available on the first page only, and at the end "Best Results" showcasing the first result ever shown on the website.
 
 ## Notice
 This tool doesn't let you download files. Simply just a search tool. It doesn't grab direct download links, it just searches and gives you the original page of the website. YOU CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING WITH THIS TOOL.
 
 ### Violation Notes
 This program shouldn't violate any ToS's of the websites included as it doesn't grab the download links. It still forwards to the original website, just the software's page of it.
