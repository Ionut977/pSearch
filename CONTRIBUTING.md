# Contribution Guidelines
Contributing to the project is available for everyone, and after sending a pull request I will check if the changes are positive and non-damaging, and I'll comment when needed.
However, there are several guidelines that you have to follow in order for your contribution to be fully valid and active.

## Database Contribution
### Adding Websites
Adding websites is possible through modifying the database file. You are allowed to:
- Add sites
- Remove sites
- Modify content in the fields of the Websites table (key1_id, key2_id,...)
- Adding content in Websites, Keys1, Keys2, Keys3, and Types tables.

You are not allowed to:
- Delete tables
- Delete fields

You have to specify from where you got the website. The websites have to be featured in a popular megathread in order for it to be added to the program, it can't be a random site as we can't specify its security.

### Adding Tables
Adding tables to the database file should have a very valid reason, so if any tables are added to the database files the contributor should explain in-detail the following points:
- The relatonship of the table with other tables
- The purpose of the table
- The contribution of the table to the program's functions


## Program Contribution
You are allowed to contribute to the actual program in any way possible, however importing more modules should have a valid reason and the contributor should explain its purpose.
<strong>All changes must have comments explaining their use and purpose in-detail.</strong>
